# Glossary  
**Key Terms in the Emergent Attractor Framework**

---

## A

**Agent** — An individual entity in the system, represented by an emotional state vector.  
**Alignment** — The process by which agents move toward shared states or attractors.  
**Attractor** — A target state or vector toward which agents converge.  
**Attractor Basin** — The region of state space from which agents converge toward an attractor.

---

## C

**Cluster** — A group of agents with similar states.  
**Compression** — Reduction of variance when agents are forced into a single state.  
**Convergence** — The process of agents approaching a stable state over time.

---

## E

**Entropy (Emotional)** — A measure of uncertainty in an agent’s emotional state.  
**Entropy (System)** — Average uncertainty across all agents.  
**Ethical Stability Theorem** — Formal statement distinguishing voluntary alignment from forced uniformity.

---

## F

**Forced Uniformity** — Alignment mechanism where agents are strongly compressed into a single state.  
**Fragility** — Lack of resilience due to collapsed variance.

---

## L

**Lemma** — Intermediate mathematical result supporting the main theorem.  
**Lyapunov Function** — A mathematical tool for proving stability.

---

## P

**PCA (Principal Component Analysis)** — Dimensionality reduction technique used to visualize agent clusters.  
**Perturbation** — External disturbance applied to the system.

---

## R

**Resilience** — The ability of a system to absorb perturbations while maintaining coherence.  
**RUN#C1** — Experimental run demonstrating voluntary alignment.  
**RUN#C2** — Experimental run demonstrating forced uniformity.

---

## V

**Variance** — Measure of spread in agent states.  
**Voluntary Alignment** — Alignment mechanism where agents converge toward an attractor while preserving diversity.
