## 4. Combined Licensing Statement

- **Code → GPLv3** (copyleft protection, prevents black box use).  
- **Documentation → CC‑BY 4.0**, with optional **CC0 waiver** (maximal freedom, but attribution encouraged).  

This hybrid model balances:
- Your intent to make the work fully free.  
- Your pragmatic concern that it should not vanish into proprietary black boxes.
