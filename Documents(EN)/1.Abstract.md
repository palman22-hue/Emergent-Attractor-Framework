# Abstract

This framework introduces a formal model for analyzing ethical stability in multi-agent systems through entropy dynamics and attractor-based alignment. Each agent is represented by a high-dimensional emotional state vector, and system-wide behavior is governed by a combination of social interaction, attractor influence, and stochastic noise.

We define emotional entropy as a measure of internal uncertainty and use it to track the evolution of agent states over time. Two classes of attractor dynamics are compared: voluntary alignment, where agents converge toward a low-entropy attractor while preserving variation; and forced uniformity, where agents are strongly compressed toward a single state.

Through simulation and theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that both dynamics can reduce entropy, but only voluntary alignment produces resilient, coherent clusters capable of adaptive behavior. Forced uniformity, while effective in reducing entropy, leads to fragile systems with minimal variation and reduced responsiveness.

These findings support the Ethical Stability Theorem: sustainable low-entropy states emerge only when agents align voluntarily around meaningful attractors. The framework offers a reproducible method for studying the relationship between ethics, entropy, and stability in complex systems.
