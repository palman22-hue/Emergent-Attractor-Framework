## 5. Experiments

Experiments/
Experiment1.MD


Contains raw experiment documentation and notes.

---

## 6. Simulation Runs

RUNC1/
RUN_C1.png
RUN_C1_CLI.png
RUN#C1.md
RUN#C1.py

RUNC2/
RUN_C2.png
RUN_C2_CLI.png

## 9. Conceptual Architecture

- **Theory Layer:** Definitions, Lemmas, Theorem, Appendix  
- **Simulation Layer:** Python scripts, runs, entropy tracking  
- **Documentation Layer:** English and Dutch write-ups  
- **Visualization Layer:** ASCII diagrams, PCA plots, entropy curves  
- **Integration Layer:** FullPaper.md and comparative analysis

## 10. Summary

The repository is structured as a modular, reproducible research lab.  
It integrates formal theory, live simulation, visual interpretation, and academic documentation — all centered on the study of emergent attractor dynamics and ethical stability in multi-agent systems.
