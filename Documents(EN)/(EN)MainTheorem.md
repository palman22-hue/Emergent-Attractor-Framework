# Main Theorem (Ethical Stability Theorem — Neutral Formulation)

**Theorem.**  
Consider a multi‑agent system in \([-1,1]^d\) with:

- social interaction between agents,
- an attractor field \(a\),
- bounded noise.

Compare two classes of dynamics:

1. **Voluntary Alignment:**  
   Agents move toward \(a\) through a combination of social interaction, attractor influence, and noise, while preserving variation.

2. **Forced Uniformity:**  
   Agents are strongly and directly pushed toward a single state \(u\), with minimal opposing variation.

Under these assumptions:

1. In both cases, the average entropy \(\bar{S}(t)\) may decrease relative to random initial conditions.  
2. Under voluntary alignment, the system forms a stable cluster around the attractor \(a\) with non‑zero spread, enabling resilience and adaptive capacity.  
3. Under forced uniformity, the system forms a highly compressed cluster around \(u\) with minimal spread, reducing adaptive capacity and increasing fragility.

**Conclusion.**  
Voluntary alignment around a low‑entropy attractor can produce both entropy reduction and resilience, whereas forced uniformity may reduce entropy but at the cost of variation and adaptive capacity.
