# Repository Overview  
**Emergent Attractor Framework: Structure, Purpose, and Philosophy**

---

## 🧠 What This Is

This repository is a formal, reproducible research lab for studying alignment, entropy, and stability in multi-agent systems.  
It combines simulation, theory, documentation, and visual interpretation — all structured for transparency and academic reuse.

## 🔧 How It Works

- Run `Exp1.py` → generates entropy logs and visual output for voluntary alignment.  
- Run `Exp2.py` → simulates forced uniformity and tracks entropy collapse.  
- Compare results in `RUN#C1VSRUN#C2.md` → includes PCA plots, entropy curves, and resilience analysis.  
- Explore theory in `Documents(EN)/` and `FullPaper/` → includes definitions, lemmas, theorem, and discussion.

## ⚖️ Licensing Philosophy

- **Code** → GPLv3: ensures openness and protects against proprietary enclosure.  
- **Documentation** → CC‑BY 4.0 with optional CC0 waiver: maximizes freedom while encouraging attribution.  
- This hybrid model reflects a balance between idealism and pragmatic protection.
