# RUN#C2 — Coercive Attractor Simulation

## 🧠 Idea Field
- Attractor vector: [-0.8, -0.8, ..., -0.8] (21D)
- Represents: suppression, fear, flattening

## 📊 Results
- Initial entropy: 0.5226
- Final entropy: 0.3236
- PCA: dense cluster near origin
- UMAP: (optioneel) compressed cloud

## 📈 Interpretation
- Entropy drops due to forced uniformity
- No emergent attractor structure
- Confirms Ethical Stability Theorem:
  - Compassion leads to stable, meaningful attractors
  - Coercion leads to fragile, compressed states
