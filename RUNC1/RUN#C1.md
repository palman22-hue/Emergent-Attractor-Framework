# RUN#C1 — Compassionate Attractor Simulation

## 🧠 Idea Field
- Attractor vector: [0.2 → 0.9] linear gradient (21D)
- Represents: compassion, connection, meaning

## 📊 Results
- Initial entropy: 0.5219
- Final entropy: 0.4972
- PCA: compact, structured cluster
- UMAP: (optioneel) coherent attractor shape

## 📈 Interpretation
- Entropy drops via emergent alignment
- Agents synchronize without suppression
- Confirms Ethical Stability Theorem:
  - Compassion leads to stable, meaningful attractors
  - System remains resilient and coherent
